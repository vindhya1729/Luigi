Luigi-API and mySQL tasks 

This is luigi basic tasks, of creating a csv sheet of data from API and mySQL database. 
Then we have aggregate task, in which both the tasks and calculates the mean of the last column of each dataset, and writes the results to an output file. 
The output file will contain two lines, each containing the mean value calculated from one of the input datasets.
We have final task, It reads numerical data from an input file produced by Aggregate_task, calculates the sum of these values, and writes the result to a 
local text file.
